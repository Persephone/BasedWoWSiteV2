Frontend in Javascript using VUEjs.

Backend is split into 2 seperate APIs.

If you want a simple solution just run the auth-service, I have extended it to now replace all the nodejs apis as its
much easier to have everything in one service than split into several.

Backend is a c# api controller which is written in .net core so itll run on almost any operating system.

Multiple realms is supported but it is a bit tedious to change it as you have to edit several files including frontend/backend.

I'll write a guide later.
